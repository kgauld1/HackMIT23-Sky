# HackMIT23-Sky

Challenge: 
Fostering positive relationships in Sky
Sky: Children of the Light has an amazing and vibrant community of socially minded players, and we at thatgamecompany work tirelessly to ensure that players feel safe and supported. To that end, we encourage and help foster relationships in our game through reinforcement of positive behaviors in a compassionate and supporting environment.

For this challenge, we've provided a set of 3D player telemetry data, including the time and position of movements, chat messages, instruments played, hands held, items purchased, etc. Given this data, we challenge participants to design and implement analyses and data visualizations that identify meaningful relationships within our game. For example, sentiment analysis can be used to determine the emotional tone of exchanges from chat data. We are also interested in maintaining the spirit of play in our game. For this challenge, participants can also opt to focus on identifying behaviors that attempt to compromise the integrity of our game systems, such as egregious gameplay hacks or attempted abuse of the underlying technology.
